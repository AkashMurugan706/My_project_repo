<p id="dd">Until now we have been writing jQuery statements one at a time (one after the other).<br>
<br>
However, there is a technique called chaining, that allows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same element(s).<br><br>

Tip: This way, browsers do not have to find the same element(s) more than once.<br><br>

To chain an action, you simply append the action to the previous action.<br><br>

The following example chains together the css(), slideUp(), and slideDown() methods. The "p1" element first changes to red, then it slides up, and then it slides down.</p>
